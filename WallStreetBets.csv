"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état. Happy Profiting on suffering welcome to capitalism.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. 

AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early.

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market. Bullshit companies and tokens are near 0 and all the craze of the market has been completely fucked out of the system - Which I have yet to see.",wallstreetbets,1667177322.0,t2_qnkazws2,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvyzj/what_is_coming_next/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/
"Betting the market stays flat, from a llama trader","So bulls are optimistic about the market, while bears are pessimistic. The latter expects the market to drop while the former expects it to rise.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November.

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink

My cousin is currently stuck in a major highway in the southern state of Santa Catarina because of protests blocking major highways and refusing to let truck drivers through.

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November.

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. 

AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early.

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market. Bullshit companies and tokens are near 0 and all the craze of the market has been completely fucked out of the system - Which I have yet to see.",wallstreetbets,1667177322.0,t2_qnkazws2,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvyzj/what_is_coming_next/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Lets review the chart:

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded.""

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état. Happy Profiting on suffering welcome to capitalism.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

Morgan Stanley's (MS) Michael Wilson says the end of the Fed's interest rate hike campaign is approaching.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again.

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

My cousin is currently stuck in a major highway in the southern state of Santa Catarina because of protests blocking major highways and refusing to let truck drivers through.

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above).

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état. Happy Profiting on suffering welcome to capitalism.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw.

Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows.

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede.

I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it.

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état. Happy Profiting on suffering welcome to capitalism.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw.

Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. 

AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early.

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Bayer cash on hand for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 was $9.195B


They have 3 main divisons 
 
All three business segments are producing essential items - this is Good during a recession -

**Crop sciences** ( which has pretty much made insane amount of  money  i don't need to tell you why) 

**Pharmaceuticals** ( which has seen an insane amount of investments towards bio sciences , from diabetes , blood pressure,  vets , cancer  and hundreds of more areas ) 

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede.

I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Obviously Parag isn't getting anything but is Elon planning lawsuits? Fascinating implications.,"&amp;#x200B;

I am really surprised that this hasn't been posted on here. It's a yuge. Elon seems to not have taken the L yet. And wasn't this to be expected of him? He likes to win. 

When you're as big an organization as Twitter, you're just not gonna be efficient at  burning evidence. There are forensic tools and what not that can be used to find gems hidden. 

Truly fascinating drama with serious complications. Better than any show.  

What do you guys think? Obviously Parag and the others aren't getting their parachutes. But beyond that, how could this drama unfold? IS THIS declaration of war? :D",wallstreetbets,1667210402.0,t2_sktl950u,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi6w66/obviously_parag_isnt_getting_anything_but_is_elon/

Brazil short short short,"The vast majority of Brazil’s GDP comes from industries and business in the Southern and South East part of the country. Those areas were heavily pro Bolsonaro 55-60%, pro gun, and a have long history of supporting separatist ideologies from the northern part of the country. Google “O sul é meu país (The south is my country.)” Bolsonaro is former military and has the support of the armed forces. My cousin is currently stuck in a major highway in the southern state of Santa Catarina because of protests blocking major highways and refusing to let truck drivers through. The people are chanting “We won’t move until the military takes the country back.” Brazil also has a long history of military take overs, so this wouldn’t be a first. Petrobras, Brazil’s largest oil company is partly owned by the federal government.

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November.

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued.

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market. Bullshit companies and tokens are near 0 and all the craze of the market has been completely fucked out of the system - Which I have yet to see.",wallstreetbets,1667177322.0,t2_qnkazws2,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvyzj/what_is_coming_next/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November.

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink

My cousin is currently stuck in a major highway in the southern state of Santa Catarina because of protests blocking major highways and refusing to let truck drivers through.

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. 

AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early.

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market. Bullshit companies and tokens are near 0 and all the craze of the market has been completely fucked out of the system - Which I have yet to see.",wallstreetbets,1667177322.0,t2_qnkazws2,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvyzj/what_is_coming_next/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded.""

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état. Happy Profiting on suffering welcome to capitalism.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

Morgan Stanley's (MS) Michael Wilson says the end of the Fed's interest rate hike campaign is approaching.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again.

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

My cousin is currently stuck in a major highway in the southern state of Santa Catarina because of protests blocking major highways and refusing to let truck drivers through. The people are chanting “We won’t move until the military takes the country back.” Brazil also has a long history of military take overs, so this wouldn’t be a first.

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above).

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état. Happy Profiting on suffering welcome to capitalism.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw.

Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows.

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état. Happy Profiting on suffering welcome to capitalism.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw.

Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. 

AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early.

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Bayer cash on hand for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 was $9.195B


They have 3 main divisons 
 
All three business segments are producing essential items - this is Good during a recession -

**Crop sciences** ( which has pretty much made insane amount of  money  i don't need to tell you why) 

**Pharmaceuticals** ( which has seen an insane amount of investments towards bio sciences , from diabetes , blood pressure,  vets , cancer  and hundreds of more areas ) 

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede.

I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Obviously Parag isn't getting anything but is Elon planning lawsuits? Fascinating implications.,"&amp;#x200B;

I am really surprised that this hasn't been posted on here. It's a yuge. Elon seems to not have taken the L yet. And wasn't this to be expected of him? He likes to win. 

When you're as big an organization as Twitter, you're just not gonna be efficient at  burning evidence. There are forensic tools and what not that can be used to find gems hidden. 

Truly fascinating drama with serious complications. Better than any show.  

What do you guys think? Obviously Parag and the others aren't getting their parachutes. But beyond that, how could this drama unfold? IS THIS declaration of war? :D",wallstreetbets,1667210402.0,t2_sktl950u,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi6w66/obviously_parag_isnt_getting_anything_but_is_elon/

Brazil short short short,"The vast majority of Brazil’s GDP comes from industries and business in the Southern and South East part of the country. Those areas were heavily pro Bolsonaro 55-60%, pro gun, and a have long history of supporting separatist ideologies from the northern part of the country. Google “O sul é meu país (The south is my country.)” Bolsonaro is former military and has the support of the armed forces. My cousin is currently stuck in a major highway in the southern state of Santa Catarina because of protests blocking major highways and refusing to let truck drivers through. The people are chanting “We won’t move until the military takes the country back.” Brazil also has a long history of military take overs, so this wouldn’t be a first. Petrobras, Brazil’s largest oil company is partly owned by the federal government.

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

"Remarks of Richard B. Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

The terminal rate does not need to go above inflation.,"Fucking stop parroting this garbage. 
Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money. 

Debt levels are way higher than they were in the 80s so interest rate hikes have an outsized impact.",wallstreetbets,1667191069.0,t2_5xsaf,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yi0vco/the_terminal_rate_does_not_need_to_go_above/

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.

5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November.

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

https://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows. Of course, this is all my speculation and anything can happen with the stock market.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence. 
The interaction between inflation and the interest rate is much more dependent on the level of debt in the economy. 

If you owe a trillion dollars and interest is 0% that's fine. But then when it's 1% that's a fuck load of money.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/

2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king:

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

Smith, Commissioner United States Securities and Exchange Commission before the American Bankers Association . . . , February 8, 1971 - when the NASDAQ began trading on February 8, 1971, as the world's first electronic stock market ""A Piece of Paper Revisited""","""What I want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper. It is nothing more than that, and yet it represents a great deal more. 

It is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community. It is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing, the most appalling reproductive capacity -- it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper, that cling to it, describe it, give it directions, authenticate it, transfer it, transform it, cancel it, encumber it. Like all relatives, these attachments are each very different and together very expensive.

The progenitor piece of paper to which I am referring, of course, is the stock certificate.""

\---

A lengthy read, that I'm too lazy to type it all out. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1971/020871smith.pdf)

Why did I come across this, some might ask? 

Well, I was trying to find out when stock market became electronic. Then I was wondering who programmed it.. 

Okay then, why am I curious about who programmed it?

I'm kindly regarded, hugely. But I still wonder things sometimes; If some of you are like me, and have been glued to these charts past 2'ish years - there's a kind of relative thing happening.. I can't quite describe it but as a uh, prolonged barrel-rolling sewing machine pattern, if that makes sense... and it's not 'making' something it's .. well, sort of seeding a landscape we're looking at from top-down..

Which got me to the wondering part, who was it that programmed the NASDAQ initially? 

6oo6ling that specific Q got me nothing so I broke down what I could possibly render a reasonable direction from: computer/software companies in the 60's

A few things stood out to me - IBM, Fortran, and [Harlan Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills) 

IBM because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then. 

"" In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than [4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1946%E2%80%931959:_Postwar_recovery,_rise_of_business_computing,_space_exploration,_the_Cold_War) were IBM machines. ""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortran](https://emmachev.com/what-is-the-difference-between-pascal-and-fortran-programming-languages/) because it is a procedural, imperative, general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations. After IBM developed it in the 1950s, it soon gained popularity in programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then Harlan Mills. Just look at his timelines and titles. Specifically -  

* Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1975–81

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thinking.. SEC knew then what we know now. Banks are assholes doing asshole stuff (if you read more of ""A Piece of Paper Revisted"" (see way above). And they figured, well, if we get rid of the human element (to some degree) this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them. 

IBM is a huge, American computer company. Invest in America, it was the 50's/60's afterall. We were boomin' baby. And they have this Fortran language that handles all kinds of processes. Then we have Harlan Mills - I mean for all what was going on above... he has a suspiciously obvious time gap.. then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth.. pretty sus cuh.

&amp;#x200B;

All right, you've gotten this far in my rabbit hole. 

Along my tinfoil travels, I came across this other dude [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Early_years) \- he apparently influenced Harlan Mills - As an IBM research fellow, Mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development. These included automata theory, the structured programming theory of Edsger Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, and others, and Markov chain-driven software testing.

But what got me in Dijkstra's 'Legacy' section was the [Banker's alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm) \- 

The Banker algorithm, sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an ""s-state"" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

And this is when I came full circle on the part above I was trying to describe at ""I'm kindly regarded."" 

Anyway, this rabbit-hole kinda tripped me out. Figured a share.

Brazil,"Brazil just finished their run-off election with Lula the former president beating the incumbent in the closest election in Brazil's democratic victory and the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has been parroting Trump leading up to the election and has yet to concede. He was a former military leader with the support of the military and in the past has spread the sentiment that he isn't leaving. I wanted exposure to the instability of the country so I bought puts in an ETF there for after the transition of power in the new year. The Brazilian market is generally up today on Lula's victory but I think the instability is not priced in. I chose the ETF EWZ as it has a higher finance exposure which should be the first sector to hurt. I see at least some instability and at most a Coup d'état.

Trading SPY and FOMC Meeting,"Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

MIDTERMS: Voters in some of the most Conservative States weighing in on Recreational Cannabis - MSOS,"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132346329/pot-marijuana-cannabis-vote-missouri-maryland-arkansas-north-south-dakota

Voters in five states, including four that are among the most conservative in the country, are deciding on whether to legalize recreational marijuana this election. If passed in each state, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota would join 19 other states and the District of Columbia where cannabis has already been legalized for personal use.

All except Maryland backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, underscoring that the legalization effort increasingly spans the political spectrum and is even gaining support in some of the most overwhelmingly Republican parts of the nation.

A recent poll from Monmouth University shows 68% of the American public supports legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. The support crosses gender, age, income and education differences, polling shows. In addition to the 19 states that have legalized personal recreational use, 37 states now allow pot for medical purposes.

""The more people learn about cannabis and cannabis policy, the more we see them support making cannabis legal and regulating it and treating it like alcohol,"" says Mason Tvert a partner at the marijuana policy and public affairs firm VS Strategies. ""This is an issue that is broadly supported by Americans of all political stripes, conservatives and progressives,"" he says.

"Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.","Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.

For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

https://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

[YTD chart of \\""airbnb\\"" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"Using CCs to reduce cost basis, and then selling more CCs off the new shares","Hi all, hope someone smarter than me could help me out with a simple question. I own a large number of shares of the world's worst stock. If I were to sell CCs against it, I understand that the premium is instantly available to use to buy whatever. The leaps of this shitty meme stock 2 years out go for a huge premium, which I could use to bring my cost basis down drastically. My question is, say I sell CCs 2 years out, and take the premium to buy even more shares, could I then sell CCs on those new shares purchased, in a sort of endless loop (it would be a bit like an asymptote I imagine), whereby I would eventually nearly double the amount of shares I own?

As far as I know, the downside would be that my max gain is limited to the strike price that I am selling at 2 years out. However, for me, since I am doubling my shares and choosing a strike that is far off the current price, this would be more than worth it and I would sell the moment the stock hits that price anyway.

Can anyone tell me if this is possible and makes sense, or am I being an idiot?

Schumer Says Congress is Very Close to Passing Cannabis Banking and Expungements Bill after Work with a Bunch of Republicans!! MSOS,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-says-congress-is-very-close-to-passing-marijuana-banking-and-expungements-bill-after-work-with-a-bunch-of-republicans/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says Congress is getting “very close” to introducing and passing a marijuana bill with provisions covering banking access for legal businesses and expungements of past convictions, citing progress he’s made in discussions with a “bunch of Republican senators.”

During a debate with his Republican reelection opponent Joe Pinion on Sunday, Schumer was asked about a separate broader cannabis legalization bill he filed this year and whether he felt it would make more sense to first promote more research into marijuana before ending prohibition.

While the top senator said that research is “very, very important,” he pointed out that “many states have approved legalization of cannabis,” and so the policy is already “upon us.”

Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says End of Fed Tightening Nearing,"The end of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates is approaching, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who until recently was a prominent stock market bear who correctly predicted this year’s slump in equities.

Indicators including the inversion of the yield curve between 10-year and three-month Treasuries -- a recession indicator with a perfect record -- “all support a Fed pivot sooner rather than later,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. “Therefore, this week’s Fed meeting is critical for the rally to continue, pause or even end completely.”

All eyes will be on the US central bank, which is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth time, while investors will be dissecting Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for guidance on future moves. US stocks have rallied over the past two weeks as traders parsed economic indicators for signs of the impact of Fed tightening, even as Big Tech earnings disappointed.

“This kind of price action isn’t unusual toward the end of the cycle particularly as the Fed moves closer to the end of its tightening campaign, something we think is approaching,” said Wilson, who was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor survey. The rally will hold up until the next 12-month earnings-per-share estimates pull back more meaningfully, he said.

Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said the potential down shift in the pace of Fed tightening, coupled with light positioning and anticipation of strong fourth-quarter seasonality is behind the lift for equity markets in recent weeks.

What is your overall sentiment in your country?,"I live in the US and I would say the sentiment is overall bearish due to the recent price correction over the past few months in stocks/cryptos, the war in Ukraine, US-China tensions, inflation, etc. I’d be interested to see what everyone’s take on the current sentiment in your country and the reasoning behind this. 

I do believe in time the market will recover but we very well could see further declines before we get a solid rebound/support. I think we need to see an end to the Ukraine war and the tapering of inflation world wide before we will see a sustained broad market gain. 

As of recently we’ve seen some price stability in many different industries, with energy leading the pack. This very well could be the support I mentioned but with the amount of uncertainty still world wide, any macro event will cause greater uncertainty and further price declines. While short term levels appear to be holding in the broad market, a break of this support would lead us to retest the March 2020 lows.

$ABNB puts or calls? Earnings play.,"I’m buying puts. Currently hold 108p for this Friday. 

My thesis is based on:

-online sentiment is garbage. Hosts and guests all complaining about bookings, fees, algorithms

-travel season is slowing down. Pandemic is over. Not getting that boost in bookings from people stuck at home. 

-the fees have gotten to a point where hotels are more attractive. I think that’s has been the case for long enough to have the market digest and suffer the consequence. I believe it will be reflected in revs.

-I heard insiders have been selling but I am not familiar enough with the company itself to rationalize exactly why. 

-regulation in some markets. 

-the niche has been bastardized by hosts looking to make a living on short term hostel style rentals. Abnb was useful for unique venues or renting a place that is otherwise not available through traditional travel avenues. Renting a bullshit converted room for $350+fees for the night is not what suits Abnb. 

-even if earnings are decent coming off of summer, I expect forward guidance to sink 

-earnings has been rough for all tech

-they trade at a hubris 50-60x P/E ratio 

Counter points: 

-travel stocks have been doing well. 

-market is irrational 

-we are still coming off of summer booking numbers this quarter which may be decent 

-people love future growth companies like Abnb

Yes Volcker raised the interest rate above inflation. However that was a coincidence.

Index &amp; US Cap Funds Vs Retirement Funds: Which is better for year to year (aggressive) growth?,"I have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity. I went over the package several times and I am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account. 

**Are the S&amp;P 500index/US Small/Mid Cap Index a better choice for retirement planning than the Target Retirement funds?** 

Right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09/12/2022:

S&amp;P 500 index has a 1Y return of 28.71%

US Small/Mid Cap Index 1Y return of 12.51%

while (based on my birthday) the Target Retirement 2065 fund 1Y return is 16.57% (MSCI US broad Mkt is 26.10% which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things)

I have always had the impression that the S&amp;P 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic Target Retirement (20XX) funds. Which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years? 

Are there other funds that I should look into to get more aggressive returns with? For example the Large Cap Equity Fund such as the Russell 1000?",wallstreetbets,1667181032.0,t2_2d3at92q,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhxhaj/index_us_cap_funds_vs_retirement_funds_which_is/
Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

I'd love to know your thoughts.",wallstreetbets,1667177326.0,t2_h6b5zhy,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvz1n/zero_day_index_options_vs_weekly_stock_options/
WHAT IS COMING NEXT!!!!!!!,"Despite a buy signal from technicals or a coming rally from divided Government coming up in a couple weeks the last thing I believe is that we have hit the bottom. There is much lower to go. The 3/10 Yield curve flashed earlier this week. Which guarantees much more fucking that is ahead for us.  I believe this is coming up next. 

1. A widening in the 3/10 yield - Yields going over 5% over the next couple of months.
2. Oil Prices to spike as soon as we finish this election and the strategic petroleum Reserves stops getting used. - Get ready for a cold and expensive winter.
3. Another spike in this inflation game - well over 10-12%. This forces the fed's hand on holding the rates higher for longer.
4. A lot of bullshit companies filing for Chapter 11 because of the new rates and the Unemployment to tick up over 4%
5.  Fed to start talking even louder but not be able to raise rates Fed Funds Rate more than 1-2% higher than current levels b/c of the 31$ Trillion national Debt.
6. A real bottom is when no one is talking about the stock market. Bullshit companies and tokens are near 0 and all the craze of the market has been completely fucked out of the system - Which I have yet to see.",wallstreetbets,1667177322.0,t2_qnkazws2,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhvyzj/what_is_coming_next/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

They have 3 main divisons 
 
All three business segments are producing essential items - this is Good during a recession -

**Crop sciences** ( which has pretty much made insane amount of  money  i don't need to tell you why) 

**Pharmaceuticals** ( which has seen an insane amount of investments towards bio sciences , from diabetes , blood pressure,  vets , cancer  and hundreds of more areas ) 

**And consumer health** which is always growing. 

**TheTop 2 problems and why they are going in favour if Bayer** 

**1) litgations 2) europe economy**

Quickly as for the European Economy it is worth noting that Germany just approved a $200B energy Stimulus designed to help companies and house holds a bail out for the upcoming winter - remember when government prints cash, assets rise. In fact Germany is likely to increase its spending, this makes the EU fearful. Germany’s plan to protect households and companies from soaring energy crises with a €200 billion investment have been heavily criticised for being a go-it-alone approach by the European Commission and member states.
About a quarter of the 200 billion will go to corporation, needless to say that Bayer stands to benefit on top of their already projected revenue increase.

- **The litigations over roundup** and *glysophate*

 Bayer is still facing litigations due to the acquisition of Monsanto and RoundUp and during the last earnings call, Werner Baumann gave updated numbers. There are about 141,000 claims in total and about 108,000 have been settled.

Remember they have already set the cash aside, have won or litigated the majority of all cases. The rest are likely to head the same path.

Here is glysophate  surging 300% in 2021 https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/crop-production/glyphosate-prices-soar-much-300-and-thats-if-you-can-even-get-it

Bayer is using crop science to go environmentally friendly to keep corporations comfortable, while  meeting the demand of a product people really  want and farmers absolutely need. 

 We know without glysopbate there is no farming,
If perhaps one day  weed control is taken care of without glysophate or any other potential harmful product, Then Bayer is likely the one that will sell you this product. Because they are by far one of the most rooted in crop science. This is  the bread and butter of there business,

Agriculture is king: 

Take a look at some of these charts in the past 59 years  have crop production globally  ever decreased over time ? Never, ever.

With crop production increasing, it drags along with it:  Crop Science

1.  Since they have taking over the company  that use to make roundup, they have face countless of lawsuits, where  claimants claim  Glysophate caused cancer 

Counter point and what investors should know :


For nearly 50 years, leading health regulators around the world have repeatedly concluded that our glyphosate products can be used safely, and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. This includes recent conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EU’s Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and the leading health authorities in Germany, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.

https://www.bayer.com/en/roundup-litigation-five-point-plan

One of Bayer's core defenses in the litigation is that the EPA has decided glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health.",wallstreetbets,1667171288.0,t2_n1jon1qs,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yht7x5/bayer_ag_and_the_german_rise/
